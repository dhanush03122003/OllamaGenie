## üõ† Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Download Python

MongoDB
Install MongoDB Community Edition
Ensure it runs locally at mongodb://localhost:27017/

Git
Download Git

Windows (for Ollama installer; other OS users must install Ollama manually)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart
1. Clone the Repository

    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/dhanush03122003/OllamaGenie.git
    cd OllamaGenie
    ```

2. Create & Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)
    ```bash 
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    ### Windows:
    ```bash 
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    ### If you get an execution policy error, use this command:
    ```bash 
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
    ```

3. Install Dependencies
    ```bash 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    On Linux, you may need:
    ```bash 
    sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
    ```

4. Install Ollama (Windows)
    >python ollama_installer.py -i "C:/ollama" -m "C:/ollama/models" -M silent

    - `-i`: Installation directory
    - `-m`: Model storage directory
    - `-M`: Installation mode (`silent` for minimal prompts)

    Non-Windows users: Install Ollama manually and ensure ollama is in your PATH.

5. Start MongoDB
    ```bash 
    mongod
    ```

    If using a remote MongoDB, update `mongo_client_url` in `chat_assistant.py`.

6. Run the Chatbot
    ```bash 
    python chat_assistant.py
    ```
